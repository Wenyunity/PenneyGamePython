# PenneyGamePython

Penney's Game involves two players picking a sequence of heads or tails. The original game uses sequences of three, although this program supports sequences of any length as well as sequences of unequal length.

The PenneyTournament file runs all possible pairs of sequences of length N against each other and finds each contestant's worst possible opponent.

## To-Do

- Make an implementation of the actual game with AI as Player 1 or 2.
